# Miyagi - ðŸ•¯ðŸ¥‹
A rust lib that helps you measure your progress and report on it. The intention is to help you report the progress of some execution in whatever form you wish.

My first rust library. Feedback and PRs very welcome.

## Why not use lib X instead?
All progress reporting libs I found either took control of the entire terminal output, or did not show an eta estimate.
